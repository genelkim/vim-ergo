# Ergo integration for Vim

These files seek to provide some basic syntax highlighting support for ErgoAI in VIM. Copy them into your `$VIM_RUNTIME` or just `~/.vim`, preserving the directory structure.

The files are public domain so far.

## Feature Highlights

- Accounts for basic Ergo syntax from tutorials
- Syntax highlighting at a level similar to the ErgoAI Studio Editor.

## Limitations

- The code has many unnecessary components from the Prolog syntax file that I based this on. As I have little experience writing VIM syntax files, I've left those around to help me in future extensions.
- Only the files in the test/ folder have been checked. Many of Ergo's extensive features are not yet supported.
